# Snake_Game
INTRODUCTION :


The name of the game is “Snake Game”, it typically involve the player controlling a line or snake. We have designed this game with the help of C++ programming language. This game is one of the earliest days computer game, and has re-emerged on mobile phones in recent years.
It is one of the  greatest game of the world, also it gives you an idea to build such projects with such a simple, understandable code, basically when you are a beginner.

So let’s talk about the gameplay, this is a single player game, involving him to control the movement of snake (line of special characters in this game) and grab all the food items appear on the console(inside the border).  Each time the snake eats the foods it’s length will increase by 1 unit and also the players score will raise by 10 points.

But wait, there is a restriction too; if the snake hit the border or collide with itself, then the game will over and program will terminate. As the length of the snake increases, the game become more and more difficult.
